1. Title
Text document Search Tool.
2. Objective
The main goal of this project is to implement a text document search tool, which
searches for documents sharing structure-andâ€“content similarity using a Vector
Space Model (VSM-based) approach.
2.1. Framework
It will be developed in the context of the IDPA course.
3. Background and Motivations
Text-rich documents are becoming increasingly available to describe all kinds of
data, from academic reports and medical reports, to news articles and blogs.
Here, we view a text document as a semi-structured document made of: a title,
sections and subsections, each with its own header, as well textual paragraphs
within each section or subsection. A sample document is shown in Figure 1, where
title and section/subsection headers are highlighted in bold.
